At the transmitter, the major part is LED array for Light Emission. Through this LED Light Emission, the data signal is transmitted. In this project, we used White Light LED because the the white light is penetrated through water easily and travels more distance due to its more wavelength.
LED is connected to the Li-Fi Module which is Transmitter. And ESP-32 Cam module is also connected to the Li-Fi module and PC.
The Li-Fi  Module acts as a intermediate to the data transimission to all components.
Python used for image transmission, Python helps for live image transmission.
