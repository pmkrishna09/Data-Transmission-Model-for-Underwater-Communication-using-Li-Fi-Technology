### üß™ In Practical Use:

- When sending data:
  - Arduino drives **LEDs** (visible light) to represent data in **on/off patterns**.
- When receiving:
  - It reads input from **LDR or photodiode** to interpret signal changes.
- When processing:
  - It can **filter noise**, buffer data, and display it on an **LCD** or forward it to a serial monitor.
