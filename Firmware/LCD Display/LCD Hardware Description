           A 16x2 LCD display is a type of liquid crystal display that is frequently used in electronic devices. It has the ability to show 16 characters on each of its two rows, providing a total of 32 characters for displaying alphanumeric information. 


The 16×2 LCD pinout is shown below.
•	Pin1 (Ground/Source Pin): This is a GND pin of display, used to connect the GND terminal of the microcontroller unit or power source.
 
•	Pin2 (VCC/Source Pin): This is the voltage supply pin of the display, used to connect the supply pin of the power source. 
•	Pin3 (V0/VEE/Control Pin): This pin regulates the difference of the display, used to connect a changeable POT that can supply 0 to 5V. 
•	Pin4 (Register Select/Control Pin): This pin toggles among command or data register, used to connect a microcontroller unit pin and obtains either 0 or 1(0 = data mode, and 1 = command mode). 
•	Pin5 (Read/Write/Control Pin): This pin toggles the display among the read or writes operation, and it is connected to a microcontroller unit pin to get either 0 or 1 (0 = Write Operation, and 1 = Read Operation). 
•	Pin 6 (Enable/Control Pin): This pin should be held high to execute Read/Write process, and it is connected to the microcontroller unit & constantly held high. 
•	Pins 7-14 (Data Pins): These pins are used to send data to the display. These pins are connected in two-wire modes like 4-wire mode and 8-wire mode. In 4-wire mode, only four pins are connected to the microcontroller unit like 0 to 3, whereas in 8-wire mode, 8-pins are connected to microcontroller unit like 0 to 7. 
•	Pin15 (+ve pin of the LED): This pin is connected to +5V 
•	Pin 16 (-ve pin of the LED): This pin is connected to GND.
